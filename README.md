# 🎯Word Guess

Word Guess is a fun and interactive **iOS word-guessing game** built with **Swift** and **UIKit**.  
Players try to guess hidden words letter by letter — each correct guess reveals more of the word, while incorrect guesses add to the total count.  
The app also provides hints and keeps track of your game statistics!
